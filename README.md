# POL-I-SEE
The aim of our project is to develop an app/website that simplifies the process of reading privacy policies by providing a summarized version of crucial aspects that users need to know before granting access to their personal information. We aim to address the growing concern about digital privacy and protect users from potential data exploitation. Our algorithm will utilize keywords to identify critical points in the policy, and we will optimize it to ensure a safer digital experience for users. Additionally, we will generate a safety score for each application based on the data collected in our database and incorporate play store ratings and application reviews to suggest alternate apps with similar features. Going forward, we also aim to increase our data corpus and utilize web scraping in order for the app to be able to access privacy policies from the Internet and summarize along with providing a privacy score. Our primary goal is to establish trust with users by being transparent and seeking legitimacy through app testing agencies.
